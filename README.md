## Hi there 👋

I'm Can aka "Kanku", a software engineer student from Thailand

I can build and design whatever in my mind

My main tech is **Angular**(TS), **Spring Boot**(Java), **.NET**(C#), and **PostgreSQL**. I can also do a React and Blazor if needed :D. 

Currently most of my repositories are for school work. But I plan to do more!

I'm currently specializing in Kafka and Devops with WLS.

Fun fact:
- I don't like coffee
- And I love energy drinks
- I'm a "Night Owl"
- I love playing "Gacha" games
- Airsoft is my favorite sport
